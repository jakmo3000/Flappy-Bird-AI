# Flappy-Bird-AI
Basically it is a crude browser version of flappy bird, a fully trained model and a genetic algorithm.
# NeuraNet
you get to watch hundreds of generations of flappy birds train!
# Fully trained 
An already fully trained neural network that can survive quite a long time

# Note 
I used a lot of code from the youtube channel The Coding Train
