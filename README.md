# Flappy-Bird-AI
Basically it is a crude browser version of flappy bird, a fully trained model and a genetic algorithm.
# NeuraNet
you get to watch hundreds of generations of flappy birds train!
# Fully trained 
An already fully trained neural network that can survive quite a long time

# Notes 
I used a lot of code from the youtube channel The Coding Train

If you want to run the genetic algorithm or the fully trained one then you need to open the index.html file in that folder.
